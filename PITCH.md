## 📊 3-Minute Demo Script

### Introduction (30 seconds)

"Hi everyone! I'm excited to show you WorkFlowly - the AI assistant that turns meetings, emails, and documents into actionable tasks automatically.

Every team struggles with the same problem: after meetings, someone has to manually create tasks, assign owners, and set deadlines. It's tedious, time-consuming, and things get missed.

WorkFlowly solves this in seconds."

### Live Demo (90 seconds)

**[Show empty task board]**

"Here's our Kanban board - currently empty. Let's change that.

**[Select 'Meeting' type]**

I'm going to upload a transcript from our sprint planning meeting.

**[Drag and drop meeting-transcript.txt]**

Just drag and drop... and click 'Extract Tasks with AI.'

**[Click button, show processing]**

WorkFlowly is now using Gemini AI to analyze the entire transcript, identify action items, extract who's responsible, and determine deadlines.

**[Tasks appear]**

And there we go! In just 5 seconds, we have 7 tasks automatically created:
- Jessica needs to build the user dashboard by January 19th
- Tom is handling API endpoints by January 11th
- Lisa is creating test cases by January 12th

Notice the confidence scores - the AI flags items it's uncertain about for human review.

**[Edit a task]**

We can easily edit any task, change assignees, update deadlines, and move tasks through our workflow.

**[Show email example]**

It works the same way with emails and documents. Just paste or upload, and WorkFlowly does the rest."

### Value Proposition (30 seconds)

"Here's the impact:
- **Time Saved**: What used to take 15 minutes now takes 5 seconds
- **Nothing Missed**: AI catches every action item
- **Instant Clarity**: Everyone knows what they need to do

Perfect for small teams that want to move fast without administrative overhead."

### Closing (30 seconds)

"WorkFlowly is built with Next.js, Express, and Google's Gemini AI. It's production-ready and can be deployed today.

Thank you! I'm happy to answer any questions."
