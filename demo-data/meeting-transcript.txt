Sprint Planning Meeting - January 8, 2024
Team: Engineering
Duration: 45 minutes

Attendees: Sarah (Product Manager), Mike (Tech Lead), Jessica (Frontend Dev), Tom (Backend Dev), Lisa (QA)

[00:00] Sarah: Alright team, let's kick off our sprint planning for Sprint 23. We have some exciting features to work on this sprint.

[02:15] Sarah: First priority is the new user dashboard. Mike, can you give us an overview of the technical approach?

[03:30] Mike: Sure. We'll need to create a new React component for the dashboard, integrate it with our existing API, and add some data visualization charts. I estimate this is about 13 story points.

[05:00] Sarah: Sounds good. Jessica, can you take the lead on the frontend implementation? We need this completed by January 19th for the demo to stakeholders.

[05:45] Jessica: Absolutely, I'll start on it tomorrow. I'll need the API endpoints ready by Friday though.

[06:20] Tom: I can have the API endpoints done by Thursday. I'll create the user analytics endpoint and the dashboard data aggregation service.

[08:00] Sarah: Perfect. Next item - we need to fix the performance issues on the search functionality. This has been a blocker for our users.

[09:15] Mike: I've been looking into this. The main issue is the database query optimization. Tom, can you work on adding proper indexes and refactoring the search queries?

[10:00] Tom: Yes, I'll prioritize that. Should be done by middle of next week.

[11:30] Sarah: Great. Lisa, we'll need comprehensive testing on both the dashboard and the search improvements.

[12:00] Lisa: I'll create test cases for the dashboard by Friday and start testing as soon as Jessica's implementation is ready. For the search optimization, I'll do performance testing to verify the improvements.

[14:00] Sarah: One more thing - we need to update our documentation. Jessica, can you handle the user-facing docs for the new dashboard?

[14:30] Jessica: Sure, I'll write the documentation as I build the feature.

[15:00] Mike: We should also schedule a code review session for the dashboard before it goes to production.

[15:30] Sarah: Good point. Let's schedule that for January 18th, one day before the demo.

[16:00] Sarah: Alright, let me summarize our commitments:
- Jessica: User dashboard frontend by January 19th
- Tom: API endpoints by January 11th, search optimization by January 15th
- Lisa: Test cases by January 12th, testing throughout sprint
- Jessica: Documentation for dashboard
- Team: Code review on January 18th

[17:00] Sarah: Any questions or concerns?

[17:30] Tom: All clear from my end.

[18:00] Jessica: Same here, looking forward to building this!

[18:30] Sarah: Excellent! Let's make this a great sprint. Meeting adjourned.
