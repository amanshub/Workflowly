Subject: Q1 Marketing Campaign Planning

Hi Team,

Hope everyone had a great weekend! I wanted to follow up on our discussion from last week about the Q1 marketing campaign.

Here are the key action items we need to tackle:

1. Sarah, could you please prepare the social media content calendar by Friday, January 12th? We need to align this with the product launch timeline.

2. Mike, I need you to finalize the budget allocation for paid ads. Can you have this ready by Wednesday so we can review it in our team meeting?

3. The design team should create mockups for the landing page by next Monday. Jessica, can you coordinate with the designers on this?

4. We also need someone to reach out to our influencer partners. Tom, would you be able to handle the outreach by end of this week?

5. Finally, let's schedule a review meeting for January 15th to go over everything before we launch.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about your assigned tasks.

Best regards,
Alex Chen
Marketing Director
